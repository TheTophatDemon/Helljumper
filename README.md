# Helljumper

### Made for Odin December Jam 2024

An isometric endless runner where you switch between heaven and hell.

Made in 48 hours for the [Odin Holiday Game Jam 2024](https://itch.io/jam/odin-holiday-jam)

Controls:

W / D / Left / Right / Left stick - Move sideways

Space / Z / Xbox A button - Jump (hold for more height)

Hold Shift Key / Left Trigger - Run faster (you WILL need to do this alot)

When you're in heaven, your score increases, but if you fall down into hell,
your score starts decreasing instead. You need to get out of Hell as soon
as you can by grabbing onto one of the giant shallots hanging down.
